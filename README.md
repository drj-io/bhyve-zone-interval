# bhyve-api-interval

This program uses the Orbit B-Hyve API to open sprinkler valves individually for a given amount of time (in seconds) and then wait for a given amount of time (in seconds) on a single Orbit B-Hyve device. You can provide a list of zones and it will run through each zone for a given number of intervals.

I use this to blow out my sprinkler system using a 2Â½ horsepower compressor.

Use at your own risk.

### Setup: config.js
You can copy `config.example.js` if you need a starting point.

`cp config.example.js config.js`

example:

```
module.exports = {
  auth: {
    email: 'your_orbit_email',
    password: 'your_pw'
  },
  device: 2, // Of index
  zoneList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
  repeatsPerZone: 15, // number of times to open each zone
  runTime: 3,  // Seconds
  delayTime: 2, // Seconds
}
```



### To just list your available devices and zones

`node run.js -l`

### Usage to run through each zone configured in config.js

`node run.js`

### New to Node JS?

Tested on MacOS, but should work on Linux and Windows.

Note: This script might not do as complete of a job at blowing out sprinklers as a professional company.  Your milage may vary depending on your compressor, your system, your climate, and other unknown factors.
